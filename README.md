Silent Lich King tracks Val'kyr HP bars and stunlock sequences to analyze diminishing returns

![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/UDh7PFR.png)

## Features

- Val'kyr HP bars, ranging from 0 to 100% in normal mode and 50 to 100% in heroic mode
- Val'kyr raid icons (white skull, red cross, etc.)
- Stuns are displayed in the order they were cast
- Mouseover a stun icon to know who did it, and for how long the stun would last
- The remaining duration of the latest stun is shown in green
- Val'kyrs are removed from the list when they go up (heroic mode only)

## Known limitations

The addon was ported from very old code that was written for 'Arthas OG'. The game has evolved quite a bit since then. Expect a few bugs and, of course, please report them.

Many options suggested with '/silk help' are not working. Currently, the ones who have been tested successfully are: /silk show, /silk resetwin, /silk test
