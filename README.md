## Known limitations

The addon was ported from very old code that was written for 'Arthas OG'. The game has evolved quite a bit since then. Please expect a few bugs and, of course, please report them.

Many options suggested with '/silk help' are not working. Currently, the ones who have been tested successfully are: /silk show, /silk resetwin, /silk test
